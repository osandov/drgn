Kallsyms
--------

The ``drgn.helpers.linux.kallsyms`` module contains helpers which allow you to
use the built-in kallsyms symbol table for drgn symbol lookup. Combined with an
alternative type information source, this can enable debugging Linux kernel core
dumps without the corresponding DWARF debuginfo files. Even without type
information, kallsyms can be used to help locate objects, and drgn's low-level
memory reading functions can be used to do basic debugging tasks.

    # single-character code that represents the nm(1) character code for that
    # symbol. However, starting with that commit, it was switched to overwrite
    # the "st_size" field instead! This was thankfully fixed in v5.2 with
    # 1c7651f43777 ("kallsyms: store type information in its own array").
    #
    # Unfortunately, this leaves us with three possibilities:
    # 1. Pre-v5.0: interpret the "st_info" as a character from nm(1) and try to
    #    infer the kind and bindings.

    # mod_kallsyms". However, cases 1 & 2 are indistinguishable. For our
    # purposes, it makes more sense to fall back to case 1. After all, neither
