    An ``Object`` represents a symbol or value in a program. An object may
    exist in the memory of the program (a *reference*), or it may be a
    temporary computed value (a *value*).

    All instances of this class have two attributes: :attr:`prog_`, the program
    that the object is from; and :attr:`type_`, the type of the object.
    Reference objects also have an :attr:`address_` attribute. Objects may also
    have a :attr:`byteorder_`, :attr:`bit_offset_`, and
    :attr:`bit_field_size_`.

    :func:`repr()` of an object returns a Python representation of the object:

    >>> print(repr(prog['jiffies']))
    Object(prog, 'volatile unsigned long', address=0xffffffffbf005000)

    :class:`str() <str>` returns a "pretty" representation of the object in
    programming language syntax:

    >>> print(prog['jiffies'])
    (volatile unsigned long)4326237045

    The output format of ``str()`` can be modified by using the
    :meth:`format_()` method instead:

    >>> sysname = prog['init_uts_ns'].name.sysname
    >>> print(sysname)
    (char [65])"Linux"
    >>> print(sysname.format_(type_name=False))
    "Linux"
    >>> print(sysname.format_(string=False))
    (char [65]){ 76, 105, 110, 117, 120 }

    .. note::

        The drgn CLI is set up so that objects are displayed in the "pretty"
        format instead of with ``repr()`` (which is the default behavior of
        Python's interactive mode). Therefore, it's usually not necessary to
        call ``print()`` in the drgn CLI.

    Objects support the following operators:

    * Arithmetic operators: ``+``, ``-``, ``*``, ``/``, ``%``
    * Bitwise operators: ``<<``, ``>>``, ``&``, ``|``, ``^``, ``~``
    * Relational operators: ``==``, ``!=``, ``<``, ``>``, ``<=``, ``>=``
    * Subscripting: :meth:`[] <__getitem__>` (Python does not have a unary
      ``*`` operator, so pointers are dereferenced with ``ptr[0]``)
    * Member access: :meth:`. <__getattribute__>` (Python does not have a
      ``->`` operator, so ``.`` is also used to access members of pointers to
      structures)
    * The address-of operator: :meth:`drgn.Object.address_of_()` (this is a
      method because Python does not have a ``&`` operator)
    * Array length: :meth:`len() <__len__>`

    These operators all have the semantics of the program's programming
    language. For example, adding two objects from a program written in C
    results in an object with a type and value according to the rules of C:

    >>> Object(prog, 'unsigned long', value=2**64 - 1) + Object(prog, 'int', value=1)
    Object(prog, 'unsigned long', value=0)

    If only one operand to a binary operator is an object, the other operand
    will be converted to an object according to the language's rules for
    literals:

    >>> Object(prog, 'char', value=0) - 1
    Object(prog, 'int', value=-1)

    The standard :class:`int() <int>`, :class:`float() <float>`, and
    :class:`bool() <bool>` functions convert an object to that Python type.
    Conversion to ``bool`` uses the programming language's notion of
    "truthiness". Additionally, certain Python functions will automatically
    coerce an object to the appropriate Python type (e.g., :func:`hex()`,
    :func:`round()`, and :meth:`list subscripting <object.__getitem__>`).

    Object attributes and methods are named with a trailing underscore to avoid
    conflicting with structure, union, or class members. The attributes and
    methods always take precedence; use :meth:`member_()` if there is a
    conflict.

    Objects are usually obtained directly from a :class:`Program`, but they can

    address from a log file).

        *value* must be given, but not both.
    :param value: The value of this object. See :meth:`value_()`.
    :param byteorder: Byte order of the object. This should be ``'little'`` or
        ``'big'``. The default is ``None``, which indicates the program byte
        order. This must be ``None`` for primitive values.
    :param bit_offset: Offset in bits from the object's address to the
        beginning of the object. The default is ``None``, which means no
        offset. This must be ``None`` for primitive values.

        The default is ``None``, which means the object is not a bit field.
