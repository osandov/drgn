class Object:
    """
    An ``Object`` represents a symbol or value in a program. An object may
    exist in the memory of the program (a *reference*), it may be a constant or
    temporary computed value (a *value*), or it may be absent entirely (an
    *absent* object).

    All instances of this class have two attributes: :attr:`prog_`, the program
    that the object is from; and :attr:`type_`, the type of the object.
    Reference objects also have an :attr:`address_` and a :attr:`bit_offset_`.
    Objects may also have a :attr:`bit_field_size_`.

    :func:`repr()` of an object returns a Python representation of the object:

    >>> print(repr(prog['jiffies']))
    Object(prog, 'volatile unsigned long', address=0xffffffffbf005000)

    :class:`str() <str>` returns a "pretty" representation of the object in
    programming language syntax:

    >>> print(prog['jiffies'])
    (volatile unsigned long)4326237045

    The output format of ``str()`` can be modified by using the
    :meth:`format_()` method instead:

    >>> sysname = prog['init_uts_ns'].name.sysname
    >>> print(sysname)
    (char [65])"Linux"
    >>> print(sysname.format_(type_name=False))
    "Linux"
    >>> print(sysname.format_(string=False))
    (char [65]){ 76, 105, 110, 117, 120 }

    .. note::

        The drgn CLI is set up so that objects are displayed in the "pretty"
        format instead of with ``repr()`` (the latter is the default behavior
        of Python's interactive mode). Therefore, it's usually not necessary to
        call ``print()`` in the drgn CLI.

    Objects support the following operators:

    * Arithmetic operators: ``+``, ``-``, ``*``, ``/``, ``%``
    * Bitwise operators: ``<<``, ``>>``, ``&``, ``|``, ``^``, ``~``
    * Relational operators: ``==``, ``!=``, ``<``, ``>``, ``<=``, ``>=``
    * Subscripting: :meth:`[] <__getitem__>` (Python does not have a unary
      ``*`` operator, so pointers are dereferenced with ``ptr[0]``)
    * Member access: :meth:`. <__getattribute__>` (Python does not have a
      ``->`` operator, so ``.`` is also used to access members of pointers to
      structures)
    * The address-of operator: :meth:`drgn.Object.address_of_()` (this is a
      method because Python does not have a ``&`` operator)
    * Array length: :meth:`len() <__len__>`

    These operators all have the semantics of the program's programming
    language. For example, adding two objects from a program written in C
    results in an object with a type and value according to the rules of C:

    >>> Object(prog, 'unsigned long', 2**64 - 1) + Object(prog, 'int', 1)
    Object(prog, 'unsigned long', value=0)

    If only one operand to a binary operator is an object, the other operand
    will be converted to an object according to the language's rules for
    literals:

    >>> Object(prog, 'char', 0) - 1
    Object(prog, 'int', value=-1)

    The standard :class:`int() <int>`, :class:`float() <float>`, and
    :class:`bool() <bool>` functions convert an object to that Python type.
    Conversion to ``bool`` uses the programming language's notion of
    "truthiness". Additionally, certain Python functions will automatically
    coerce an object to the appropriate Python type (e.g., :func:`hex()`,
    :func:`round()`, and :meth:`list subscripting <object.__getitem__>`).

    Object attributes and methods are named with a trailing underscore to avoid
    conflicting with structure, union, or class members. The attributes and
    methods always take precedence; use :meth:`member_()` if there is a
    conflict.

    Objects are usually obtained directly from a :class:`Program`, but they can
    be constructed manually, as well (for example, if you got a variable
    address from a log file).

    integer, structure) has different attributes (e.g., name, size). Types can
    also have qualifiers (e.g., constant, atomic). Accessing an attribute which
    does not apply to a type raises an :exc:`AttributeError`.

    :func:`repr()` of a ``Type`` returns a Python representation of the type:

    >>> print(repr(prog.type('sector_t')))
    prog.typedef_type(name='sector_t', type=prog.int_type(name='unsigned long', size=8, is_signed=False))

    :class:`str() <str>` returns a representation of the type in programming
    language syntax:

    >>> print(prog.type('sector_t'))
    typedef unsigned long sector_t

    The drgn CLI is set up so that types are displayed with ``str()`` instead
    of ``repr()`` by default.

    This class cannot be constructed directly. Instead, use one of the
    :ref:`api-type-constructors`.
